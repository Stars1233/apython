; modules/posixfd.asm - the two descriptor calls that are neither a read nor a
; write: fcntl and flock
;
; A new file rather than more of posix.asm, which is within a few kilobytes of
; the 100k cap that src/compiler/lint.py holds hand-written files to.  The
; seam is the one posix.ioctl's docblock already names: the raw call belongs
; in assembly and the CONSTANTS -- F_GETFL, LOCK_EX and the hundred-odd names
; CPython's fcntl module publishes -- belong in Python, so lib/fcntl.py is
; written against these two the way lib/select.py is written against
; _socketcore.
;
; Both take the same shape as posix.ioctl, and for the same reason: a bytes
; argument is a STRUCT the kernel writes through, so it is copied into a
; buffer, handed over, and given back as bytes.  `struct flock` is 32 bytes
; and F_GETLK is the call that needs it; CPython's buffer is 1024, and so is
; this one, because that is the size its ValueError names.

;; posix.fcntl(fd, cmd, arg=0) -> int, or bytes when arg was bytes-like
;;
;; CPython's fcntl.fcntl, minus the constants.  An integer argument is passed
;; by value and the call's own result comes back; a bytes-like one is a struct
;; the kernel reads and writes through -- F_GETLK fills in a `struct flock` --
;; so it is copied into a buffer of this frame, passed by address, and the
;; buffer is handed back as a new bytes of the same length.
;;
;; The buffer is 1024 bytes because that is the size CPython's message names,
;; and a longer argument is refused rather than truncated: truncating one
;; would hand the kernel a struct with a missing tail.
