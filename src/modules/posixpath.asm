; modules/posixpath.asm - how an argument becomes a path, and how a bad one
; is refused
;
; Split out of posix.asm, which was at the 100k cap that src/compiler/lint.py
; holds hand-written files to.  This is a seam the file already had: the
; syscall wrappers all begin by turning one argument into a NUL-terminated C
; string, and posix_path_arg is the only thing that knows how -- str, str
; subclass, bytes, bytes subclass, or one __fspath__ step, with the embedded
; NUL refused before any of it reaches the kernel.
;
; It is not only posix's.  _io.FileIO opens its path from here too, which is
; what fixed `open(b"...")` and `open(S("..."))` for a str subclass; the
; refusal it wants is worded differently, which is what POSIX_PATH_KIND_IO is.
;
; The message builders it calls -- posix_typename_of, posix_copy_bounded,
; posix_raise_typename -- and the buffer they write into stay in posix.asm,
; where a dozen other refusals share them.

; threw the distinction away: .ppa_str and .ppa_bytes converged and every
; caller built str.  os.scandir(b'.'), os.listdir(b'.') and os.readlink on a

;;   -> eax = 1 when there is a NUL before the end, 0 when the string is
;;      clean
;;
;; A C string ends at the first NUL and a Python str does not, so handing one
;; straight to a syscall acts on a PREFIX of what the caller asked for --
;; silently, which is how a checked path becomes a different path.  CPython
;; refuses rather than truncating, and so does everything here.
;;
;; The test is the declared length against the C length.  It is safe to run
;; ap_strlen past the characters because every PyStrObject and every
;; PyBytesObject is NUL-terminated; src/pyo/bytes.asm's header records that
;; this comparison is the reason.
;;
;; Its callers are posix_path_arg below, the three string vectors in
;; posixproc.asm, and FileIO's own open path in modules/io.asm.  The last
;; four had no check at all: os.execv(p, ["sh", "-c", "x\0y"]) passed "x",
;; and open("a\0b") opened "a".
