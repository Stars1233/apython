; frame.asm - Frame allocation and deallocation
; Manages execution frames for the bytecode interpreter
;
; Frame pooling: 4 size classes (256, 512, 1024, 2048 bytes).
; Each class has a freelist (singly-linked, max FRAME_POOL_MAX_FREE entries).
; frame_pool_get(size) checks freelist first, falls back to ap_malloc.
; frame_pool_put(frame, size) pushes to freelist or ap_free if full.

; The pool's constants live in object.inc, beside PyFrame: the specialized
; call pops the smallest class inline and needs them too.  A pool record is
; (head, count), selected as a unit with `lea rcx, [rel frame_pool_free_N]`
; and then indexed -- the count was once reached as a bare [rcx + 8], which
; made frame_pool_count_N decoration.


;; ============================================================================
;; THE FRAME DATASTACK
;;
;; A frame pushed inline by the specialized call has a lifetime the
;; interpreter can prove.  That handler's guards refuse CO_GENERATOR,
;; CO_COROUTINE and CO_ASYNC_GENERATOR -- the only shapes that return with the
;; frame still live -- so such a frame is always released by the resume of the
;; very call that made it.  Inline calls nest, so their frames nest, so the
;; region they come from can be a bump pointer: an allocation is an add and a
;; compare, a release is one store, against a four-way size ladder and a
;; capped freelist each way.
;;
;; Everything else still comes from the pool -- module bodies, eval(), class
;; bodies, generators, func_call's slow path -- so nothing about a generator
;; frame's lifetime changes, and frame_free tells the two apart by address.
;;
;; The region is not grown.  Running out falls back to the pool, which is
;; correct if slower, and stays correct while both are in use: a datastack
;; frame's callee may come from the pool without disturbing the top, and the
;; datastack frames that remain still nest among themselves.
;;
;; Four megabytes is about sixteen thousand frames of the smallest size,
;; against a default recursion limit of a thousand.  It is malloc'd on the
;; first inline call rather than at startup, so a program that makes none --
;; and the .pyc probes are full of them -- pays nothing.

;; the region does not exist yet or has no room.  Falling back to the pool is
