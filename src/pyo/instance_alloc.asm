; pyo/instance_alloc.asm - allocating an instance, and the builtin-subclass forms
;
; instance_new is where every user-defined class's instance comes from.  A
; class deriving from a builtin needs more than a zeroed body: the base's own
; fields are embedded in the instance, and list and dict want a real backing
; array before any method touches them -- a NULL ob_item is how list marks
; "currently being sorted", so the first append on a fresh subclass instance
; reported "list modified during sort".  int, str and tuple are immutable and
; carry their value inline, so each gets a constructor of its own that fills
; the base portion at allocation time and can be called as `int.__new__(cls,
; v)` without going back through cls.__new__ -- which is how enum builds its
; members, and would otherwise recurse forever.
;
; It came out of class.asm, which held the metatype, the instance, the bound
; method and this, and was over the size a hand-written file in this tree is
; allowed.

;; "defines __new__ in Python" is `tp_new == slot_tp_new`; this tree has no

;; The owner and not the type's own dict, because the property is inherited.
;; `class Mixed(P, L2)` defines no `__new__` of its own, but the one it finds

;; reports `list`, and asking Mixed's own dict would stop at Mixed and report
;; the wrong name.
;;
;; object always terminates the walk: its `__new__` is in its own dict and it
