; subclasses.asm - the direct-subclass side table behind type.__subclasses__
;
; A class does not carry a list of its subclasses.  Giving it one would mean a
; new field in PyTypeObject and an edit to every static type table in the
; tree, so the links live in a side table keyed by the base's address -- the
; shape _weakref already uses, and for the same reason.  The table is empty
; until the first class is built, and obj_dealloc's check against it is one
; compare with a counter.
;
; The entries are BORROWED, which is what CPython's weak-referenced
; tp_subclasses amounts to: a class is recorded when it is created and removed
; when it is freed, so the list only ever holds live classes.
;
; Borrowed is why the entries are NOT in a Python list.  Two things go wrong
; if they are, and both were seen:
;
;   - list_append takes a reference, so every class became immortal;
;   - and giving it back is not enough, because a list is GC-visible.  The
;     collector walks it from the table -- which is a root -- reaches the
;     class and marks it alive.  A borrowed pointer inside a tracked container
;     reachable from a root is not borrowed as far as the collector is
;     concerned.
;   - and a list DEALLOCATES its items, so dropping the list released classes
;     it never owned.
;
; So each base's subclasses live in a SubList: an ap_malloc'd header and a
; plain array of PyTypeObject*, outside the object system entirely.  The dict
; holds its address as an int immediate, which owns nothing and is not
; traversed.
