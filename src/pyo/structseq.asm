; structseq.asm - tuple-with-named-fields, the shape os.stat() returns
;
; A struct sequence is a tuple whose entries also have names, plus a tail of
; fields reachable only by name.  os.stat() returns one; so do os.uname(),
; os.terminal_size(), sys.version_info and its three siblings.
;
; The instance IS a tuple -- the PyTupleObject header sits at offset 0, so
; every piece of tuple code reads it unchanged, `isinstance(st, tuple)` is
; True, unpacking works, and tuple's own methods come through the MRO from
; tuple_type.tp_dict.  bool_type does exactly this one layer down: a static
; type whose tp_basicsize is its base's, with tp_base patched at init.
;
;     +0   ob_refcnt   }
;     +8   ob_type     }  PyTupleObject, read verbatim by tuple's code
;     +16  ob_size     }  = n_in_sequence, NOT the field count
;     +24  ob_hash     }
;     +32  ob_item -> Value[n_in_sequence]
;     +40  the named-only fields, one Value each
;
; ob_item is a separate allocation rather than inline storage, which is what
; makes the tail safe: nothing tuple does can reach past the 40-byte header.
; That is the difference from str and bytes, whose subclasses need
; TP_DICT_AT_TAIL because their data IS inline.
;
; Each type carries a StructSeqDesc pointer in one extra qword just past
; PyTypeObject, so tp_getattr, tp_repr and tp_dealloc can all find their own
; descriptor from the instance's type.  Without it every type would need
; three thunks whose only job was to name a table.
;
; NOT GC-tracked, and deliberately.  A struct sequence holds numbers and
; strings; it cannot be part of a cycle, and CPython's are not tracked
; either.  So: ap_malloc, no tp_traverse, no TYPE_FLAG_HAVE_GC -- and its own
; tp_dealloc, because tuple_dealloc would hand a 40-plus-tail object to the
; tuple free pool, from which it would come back out as a plain tuple.
