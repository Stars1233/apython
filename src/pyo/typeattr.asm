; typeattr.asm - reading and writing a class's attributes: `type_getattr`
; itself, the descriptors `type.__dict__` answers those attributes through,
; `type.mro()`, and `type_setattr`.
;
; type_getattr and type_getattr_meta came over when class.asm reached the 100k
; cap a second time.  This is where they belong: the getset thunks below were
; already written as "load the interned name and hand it to type_getattr", and
; type_setattr special-cases the same names the read does.  What stayed in
; class.asm is the class and the INSTANCE -- construction, the reprs, dealloc
; and the collector's view of both.
;
; type_setattr came over when class.asm reached the 100k cap.  It belongs
; here by subject: every name it special-cases -- __name__, and the refusal a
; static type gives -- is one of the attributes this file already answers
; the read of.
;
; `C.__mro__` has worked for a long time: type_getattr special-cases the name
; before it walks anything.  What did not exist was the entry in
; `type.__dict__` that CPython answers it THROUGH, and the stdlib reaches for
; that entry directly rather than for the attribute --
;
;     _static_getmro = type.__dict__['__mro__'].__get__
;
; is inspect.py's way of reading an MRO without triggering a __getattr__, and
; it is a KeyError without one.  inspect is imported by dataclasses, pdb,
; pydoc, doctest, unittest and asyncio, so the one missing key stopped a
; seventh of the standard library.
;
; Each descriptor is a getset whose getter is a two-instruction thunk: load
; the interned name for its slot, and hand it to type_getattr, which already
; knows how to answer it.  That keeps one implementation of what `__mro__`
; means rather than two that can drift, and it is why a static type with no
; tp_mro answers here too -- the synthesis lives there.
