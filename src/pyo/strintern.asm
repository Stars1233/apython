; pyo/strintern.asm - the string intern table
;
; One table, mapping a run of bytes to the single PyStrObject that stands for
; it.  Identifiers coming out of marshal and out of our own compiler go through
; it, so that the same name written in two modules -- or in two functions of
; one module -- is one object.
;
; WHY A TABLE OF ITS OWN AND NOT A dict
;
; Two reasons, both structural rather than stylistic.
;
; The callers have `(const char *, len)` in hand and no object yet.  A dict
; would force `str_new_heap` -> look up -> free the duplicate on every HIT,
; which is an allocate, a copy and a free per token of every file compiled.
; A byte-keyed probe allocates only on a miss.
;
; And `dict`'s comparison path can raise: `dict_keys_equal`'s error arm is
; `jmp eval_exception_unwind`, which calls `fatal_error` when there is no live
; interpreter frame -- and `./apython foo.py` compiles before any frame exists.
; That is the rule in CLAUDE.md that `src/compiler/` must never reach
; `raise_exception`, arrived at from the other direction.  Nothing here calls
; anything but `ap_malloc`, `ap_memcmp`, `str_hash_bytes` and the refcount
; helpers.
;
; WHAT IS INTERNED
;
; The rules are CPython's, and the second one is the guard rail:
;
;   - a NAME, unconditionally.  Identifiers are what benefit; `co_names` is
;     where the attribute cache compares by pointer.
;   - a str CONSTANT only when every byte is [A-Za-z0-9_].  So `"hello"` is
;     shared between modules and `"hello world"` and `"ete"` with an accent are
;     NOT.  Over-interning is invisible in a single module and shows up as two
;     modules' unrelated long strings sharing an object.
;
; THE TABLE NEVER EVICTS, AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING
;
; `CompUnit.names` holds BORROWED pointers -- the object arena owns them -- and
; an interned name outlives the arena.  Never evicting makes those borrowed
; pointers valid for the life of the process, which is a stronger invariant
; than the one recorded in `src/compiler/compile.asm`.  The cost is that the
; table shows as "still reachable" under valgrind.  That is deliberate; it is
; not a leak to be fixed.
