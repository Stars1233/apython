; systrace.asm - sys.settrace and sys.setprofile, and the events they see.
;
; CPython 3.12 builds these on top of PEP 669's sys.monitoring; this builds
; them directly.  Monitoring would need a writable, versioned co_code and a
; second set of INSTRUMENTED_* opcodes to swap into it, and co_code here is
; inline object payload that arrives from marshal.  CPython layered them this
; way through 3.11 and inverted it only to serve monitoring, which nothing
; here asks for.
;
; WHAT IT COSTS WHEN IT IS OFF: nothing.  DISPATCH already jumps through
; opcode_dispatch_table -- a pointer, not the table -- because `-t` needed
; somewhere to interpose, and 222 expansions of the macro already pay for the
; load.  Turning tracing on stores opcode_trace_table there; turning it off
; stores opcode_table back.  A `cmp [rel tracing]` inside DISPATCH would have
; been strictly worse: a second conditional branch at each of those 222 sites,
; against a design that deliberately spends one BTB entry per site on the
; indirect jump so each predicts its own successor.
;
; THE EVENTS, and where each is raised from:
;
;   'call'      eval_frame, once the frame's globals and eval_base_rsp are in
;               place so a raise from the tracer unwinds through it
;   'line'      the dispatch thunk, when the line changes or a jump goes
;               backwards
;   'opcode'    the same thunk, when the frame asked for f_trace_opcodes
;   'return'    the top of eval_return, which is the single exit -- a return,
;               a yield and the unwinder's .no_handler all reach it.  rax and
;               current_exception between them say which of CPython's
;               PY_RETURN / PY_YIELD / PY_UNWIND it is, and all three map to
;               'return' the way CPython's legacy layer maps them
;   'exception' eval_exception_unwind, which is entered once per frame as an
;               exception propagates outward
;
; THE LINE RULE.  CPython decides statically which instructions start a line
; and then suppresses at run time when the dynamically previous instruction
; had the same line; on top of that it fires on EVERY backward jump, even
; within one line, which is what makes `while True: pass` traceable.  Here the
; static half is folded into the dynamic one: an event fires when the line
; differs from the last one reported, or when the offset went backwards.  The
; two are equivalent for compiler output.  END_FOR, END_SEND and RESUME need
; no special case -- the first two are only ever reached from an instruction on
; their own line, and RESUME is covered by the reset at frame entry, which is
; exactly why CPython special-cases it.
;
; RE-ENTRY.  tracing_depth is non-zero for the whole of a callback, so a trace
; function that itself runs Python is not traced.  sys.call_tracing exists to
; turn that off deliberately, and is four instructions, as CPython's is.
