; opcodes/build_spec.asm - the specialized container and iteration opcodes

; Split out of build.asm, which keeps the generic handlers and the error
; messages, because that file had 3.5k left under lint's 100k cap for a
; hand-written file -- not enough for the subscript and unpack specializations
; that belong beside these.  Same seam as arith.asm/arith_spec.asm and
; load.asm/load_ic.asm: nothing here calls a file-local helper of the file it
; came from.
;
; FOR_ITER carries a jump offset that can be preceded by an EXTENDED_ARG, so
; the deopts here jump to op_for_iter with ecx intact rather than rewinding
; rbx by two -- rewinding would land past the prefix and read the low byte of
; the offset as the whole of it, jumping into the middle of the loop body on
; exhaustion.  op_for_iter_list keeps the offset on the machine stack because
; it uses rcx as its loop index, and each of its three exits has to dispose of
; that push.

;; The subscript specializations
;;
;; A list and a tuple have ob_size at +16 and ob_item at +32 alike, so one
;; body serves both and the two handlers differ only in the type they compare
;; against.  BSUB_INT_BODY generates them.
;;
;; What they replace is not one call but two: op_binary_subscr reaches
;; list_subscript through tp_as_mapping->mp_subscript, and list_subscript
;; calls list_getitem, each with a full prologue, either side of four machine
;; pushes and a V_PACK/V_UNPACK round trip on the key.  A guarded inline read
;; is about a dozen instructions and no call at all.
;;
;; BINARY_SUBSCR and STORE_SUBSCR carry no oparg -- op_meta gives neither
;; OM_HASARG -- so neither can ever be preceded by an EXTENDED_ARG, and the
;; cheap deopt is available: write the generic opcode byte back, rewind rbx by
;; the two bytes DISPATCH advanced it, and re-dispatch.  Nothing is popped
;; before a deopt can be taken, so there is nothing to put back.
;;
;; An index out of range deopts rather than raising here.  The generic handler
;; owns the IndexError and its wording, and a site that goes out of range is a
;; site that is about to raise anyway.
