; opcodes/exc.asm - The exception opcodes
;
; PUSH_EXC_INFO, POP_EXCEPT, CHECK_EXC_MATCH, CHECK_EG_MATCH, RAISE_VARARGS and
; RERAISE.  They lived in eval.asm, which CLAUDE.md describes as the dispatch
; loop and nothing else; the unwinder they cooperate with -- and which does
; belong there -- is eval_exception_unwind.
;
; Register convention (callee-saved, preserved across handlers):
;   rbx = bytecode instruction pointer (current position in co_code[])
;   r12 = current frame pointer (PyFrame*)
;   r13 = value stack top pointer (Value[], one 64-bit word per slot)
;   r14 = co_consts tuple data pointer (&tuple.ob_item[0])
;   r15 = free
;
; co_names is accessed via the LOAD_CO_NAMES macro (reads a global).
; ecx = opcode argument on entry (set by eval_dispatch)
; rbx has already been advanced past the 2-byte instruction word.
