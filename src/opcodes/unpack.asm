; opcodes/unpack.asm - UNPACK_SEQUENCE and UNPACK_EX
;
; The two opcodes behind `a, b = x` and `a, *b, c = x`, and the ValueError
; they share.  Split out of opcodes/build.asm, which had reached the 100k cap
; for a hand-written file; the seam is the one it already had -- these two
; are the only handlers in it that take a sequence APART, and the only ones
; that answer for a length.
;
; Register convention (callee-saved, preserved across handlers):
;   rbx = bytecode instruction pointer (current position in co_code[])
;   r12 = current frame pointer (PyFrame*)
;   r13 = value stack payload top pointer
;
; ecx = opcode argument on entry (set by eval_dispatch)
; rbx has already been advanced past the 2-byte instruction word.
