; opcodes/call_spec.asm - the specialized call
;
; CALL had no specialization at all where CPython 3.12 has seventeen, and a
; profile of a call-heavy benchmark put roughly half its instructions in the
; call machinery: op_call 12%, func_call 8%, frame_new and frame_free 15%,
; eval_frame and eval_return 17%.
;
; This takes the first two.  A call whose callable is a plain Python function
; and whose arguments exactly fill its parameters needs none of op_call's
; 104-byte frame, its tp_call indirection, its profiling gate or its cleanup
; loop, and none of func_call's prologue, keyword handling or six binder
; phases -- func.asm already isolates exactly this predicate and calls it "the
; shape almost every call has".
;
; Both call shapes are handled, because the second is the one that matters for
; object-oriented code: LOAD_ATTR_METHOD leaves [method, self] on the stack
; with self already contiguous with the arguments, so a method call is the
; plain case with one more argument and the callable one slot deeper.  That
; layout exists precisely so no argument array has to be built.
;
; The frame is now pushed WITHOUT a C-level call: the handler builds it, writes
; PyFrame.entry_kind, and jumps into eval_frame rather than calling it.
; eval_return reads that field while the frame is still current, restores the
; caller exactly as it always did, and jumps to eval_inline_resume below
; instead of returning.  What is still shared, unchanged, is eval_frame's whole
; prologue and eval_return's whole restore -- the 19-word state block, the
; handled_exception swap, prev_frame linking, eval_base_rsp, the recursion
; count and the trace hooks.
;
; The frame allocation is still frame_new's.
;
; A generator, coroutine or async generator is refused at the guard.  Such a
; call returns with the frame still live -- op_return_generator hands it to the
; generator object and func_call reads instr_ptr to decide not to free it --
; and this handler frees unconditionally.  That guard is load-bearing twice
; over: the unconditional frame_free is also what lets the arguments' stack
; references be MOVED into the frame rather than copied.

;; ============================================================================
;; op_call_py_exact (241) -> nothing; replaces the call sequence with its result
;;
;; Guards, in the order that rejects soonest:
;;   - no keyword names pending
;;   - the callable is exactly a Python function
;;   - its parameters are exactly filled: argcount matches, no keyword-only
;;     parameters, no *args or **kwargs
;;   - it is not a generator, coroutine or async generator
;;
;; CALL carries an oparg, so the deopt jumps to op_call with ecx intact rather
;; than rewinding rbx.  Nothing is popped before the last guard.
;;
;; Stack, top last:  func_or_null, callable_or_self, arg0 .. argN-1
;; A NULL in the first slot means the second is the function and the arguments
;; are the N; a non-NULL means the first is the method, the second is self, and
;; the arguments are self plus the N.  Either way N+2 slots go and one comes
;; back, and the values to release are the arguments plus the callable -- which
;; is the slot immediately below them in both shapes.
;; ============================================================================
;; The handler has no frame of its own.  It used to need one to hold four
;; values across `call frame_new` and `call eval_frame`; the second is gone and
;; the first has become a `call frame_pool_get` on the slow path only, so on
;; the path every call takes nothing is spilled at all.  A handler is entered
;; with rsp 16-aligned and DEF_FUNC_BARE leaves it there, which is the parity
;; the one call below wants.
