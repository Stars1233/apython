; opcodes/load_ic.asm - the inline-cache opcodes for loads
;
; The four specialized load handlers, each of which rewrites itself into the
; bytecode once the generic handler has seen what the site actually does, and
; each of which guards the shape it was specialized for:
;
;   200  LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE     name found in the module globals
;   201  LOAD_GLOBAL_BUILTIN    name found in builtins
;   203  LOAD_ATTR_METHOD       a method reached through the type dict
;   204  LOAD_ATTR_INSTANCE     a plain attribute reached through the instance
;   240  STORE_ATTR_INSTANCE    a plain attribute written through the instance
;
; Split out of load.asm, which keeps the generic handlers, the attribute
; protocol and the error messages, because that file had reached lint's 100k
; cap for a hand-written file with 107 bytes to spare -- so no fix to any of
; these could be written at all.  The seam is the one arith.asm and
; arith_spec.asm already use, and it works for the same reason: nothing here
; calls into load.asm's file-local helpers.  Each deopt writes the generic
; opcode byte back and jumps to the generic handler, entering it with ecx
; still holding the full oparg.
;
; That last point is not a detail.  LOAD_ATTR and LOAD_GLOBAL take a name
; index wide enough to carry an EXTENDED_ARG prefix, and op_extended_arg
; composes the full argument into ecx and jumps without leaving it anywhere in
; the byte stream.  Rewinding rbx by two to re-dispatch would land past the
; prefix and read the low byte as the whole argument; these deopt by jumping
; instead, and nothing between a handler's entry and its deopt label may touch
; rcx.
