; typecache.asm - one answer for "what does this class call that name?"
;
; Resolving an attribute through a class means walking its MRO and probing
; each tp_dict, and MRO_NEXT is an out-of-line call to type_mro_next -- so a
; lookup of depth d costs d function calls and d hash-and-probes.  Nothing
; about the answer changes between two lookups unless the class or one of its
; bases is written to, and tp_version already says exactly that: it is stamped
; fresh by type_refresh_attr_flags, which runs at class creation and from
; type_setattr and pushes its answer down every subclass.
;
; So the cache needs no invalidation of its own.  A stale entry fails the
; version compare and is simply overwritten; there is no list to walk when a
; class changes and no way to miss one.  Versions come from a single global
; counter, so an entry can never be matched by a different class that happens
; to reuse a freed address.
;
; A profile of an attribute-heavy object benchmark put 32% of its instructions
; in dict_lookup and 8% in type_mro_next, nearly all of it reached from this
; walk -- and that benchmark's classes carry a property, which sets
; TYPE_FLAG_MRO_HAS_DATA_DESCR and so forces the descriptor-first order on
; every attribute, not just the one that is a descriptor.
;
; Only a type that HAS a version is cached, which means heap types.  A static
; type reads zero there and keeps walking: its dict is filled during startup
; by methods/init.asm, in writes that go nowhere near type_setattr, so a
; version handed out before that finished would be a promise the tree does not
; keep.  Giving the builtins versions is worth doing and wants an explicit
; "startup is over" point to do it at.
