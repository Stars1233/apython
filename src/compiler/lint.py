"""Static checks over the assembly, for bug classes that are invisible at
assembly time and expensive to find at runtime.

Most checks run over every hand-written .asm in the tree; the rest are scoped
to src/compiler plus src/main.asm, because the rest of src/ predates the
alignment rule and would drown the signal.  See STYLE.md for which is which.

The two that started it both bit during development:

  1. Reading a 4-byte struct field with a 64-bit `mov`.  NASM assembles it
     happily; it silently picks up the next field as the high half.  A
     `mov rdx, [rsi + Token.len]` read the length OR'd with the column, and
     turned into a multi-gigabyte memcpy.

  2. A call made with rsp not 16-byte aligned.  The SysV ABI requires it and
     glibc's floating-point paths (strtod, which the number scanner uses) do
     use aligned SSE stores.  After DEF_FUNC's `push rbp`, `sub rsp, N` and P
     register pushes, alignment holds when (N + 8*P) is a multiple of 16.

The tree-wide six are there on the opposite grounds: the tree already had zero
violations of each, so turning them on cost nothing and keeps it that way.  The
exception was the 4-byte field check, which found one real 8-byte read of
SRE_PatternObject.flags the moment include/sre.inc was added to its field list.

Run standalone, or as part of `make check`.

    A handler is reached by `jmp` from the dispatcher, not by `call`, so there
    is no return address and rsp is 16-byte ALIGNED on entry -- the opposite of
    an ordinary function.  A call inside one therefore needs an EVEN number of
    8-byte slots pushed, where an ordinary DEF_FUNC_BARE function needs an odd
    one.  check_alignment above cannot see this: it counts only prologue
    pushes, and a handler's pushes are usually mid-body around the call.

    Fourteen calls across twelve handlers were misaligned when this was
    written, some of them under comments asserting the opposite.  glibc's
    allocator and strtod do use aligned SSE, and DECREF reaches free().

    Both forms are checked, and they want OPPOSITE parities.  A DEF_FUNC
    handler's own `push rbp` is an odd slot, so it needs FRAME + 8*pushes to be
    8 mod 16 where a DEF_FUNC_BARE one needs 0.  Checking only the BARE form
    was a blind spot that left 25 handlers -- op_call, op_load_attr,
    op_store_attr, op_build_string and the rest -- calling glibc misaligned
    under comments computing the ordinary-function rule.

    Which functions are handlers is read from the dispatch table in eval.asm
    rather than guessed from the name, because plenty of DEF_FUNC_BARE
    functions beginning with op_ are called normally.

    The walk is linear and stops trusting its count at the first label, since
    a label may be reached at more than one depth.  That leaves some calls
    unchecked rather than reporting them wrongly.
