; init_iter.asm - the builtin iterators' tp_dict, built from one table
;
; Every one of these types has a live tp_iternext and a tp_iter and, until
; this file, no way to reach either by NAME.  The stdlib asks by name
; constantly -- heapq.py has `next = it.__next__` at module level, inspect.py
; has `iter(lines).__next__` -- and CLAUDE.md's "a builtin's behaviour that
; lives only in a slot" is exactly this failure: `hasattr(it, '__next__')` was
; False for every builtin iterator in the tree.
;
; A table rather than twenty-two open-coded blocks, on the model of
; set_add_operator_methods in init.asm: each is otherwise the same four lines,
; and a block per type is where a missing type_stamp_methods hides.  It lives
; in its own file because init.asm is within a couple of kilobytes of the
; hand-written 100k cap.
;
; The thunks themselves are DEF_DUNDER_ITER / DEF_DUNDER_NEXT in
; methods/object.asm, beside every other dunder generator -- a NASM macro does
; not cross a file boundary, and that is where the macros are.  Both read the
; DEFINING type's slot, so a subclass that defines __next__ does not
; re-dispatch into itself.
