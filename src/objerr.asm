; objerr.asm - the arity and receiver error messages.
;
; Split out of object.asm, which reached the 100k cap that src/compiler/lint.py
; enforces.  The seam is the one object.asm already had: these six build a
; message into a stack buffer and hand it to raise_exception, and none of them
; returns.  They share nothing with the object protocol above them but the two
; append helpers, and every one of them exists for the same reason -- CPython
; reports the count and the receiver it actually got, and this tree used to
; report the rule and leave the caller to guess what it had passed.
;
; The remaining raise_* helpers stay in object.asm: they are interleaved with
; value_type, dunder_require_self and the msg_append_* primitives they are
; built on, and cutting between them would mean moving those too.
