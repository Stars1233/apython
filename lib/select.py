"""select - waiting on descriptors, over poll().

CPython's select module wraps four different multiplexers; two of them are
here -- poll() and epoll() -- with select() written on top of poll.  Both are
_socketcore's syscalls with the registry, the timeouts and the object
lifetime in Python, which is the same split the socket type itself uses.

kqueue and devpoll are absent, and their absence is the supported way to say
so: selectors and asyncio both ask with hasattr.

Adding epoll changes what Lib/selectors.py's DefaultSelector picks --
EpollSelector rather than PollSelector -- because that file gates on
`hasattr(select, "epoll")`.  tests/test_async_backends.py runs the async
suite over both.
