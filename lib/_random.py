"""_random - the class surface over the MT19937 in src/modules/random.asm.

CPython puts the Mersenne Twister in C for speed, and so does this: the twist
is a 624-iteration loop of shifts and xors, and an interpreter running it one
bytecode at a time cannot be made fast.  What was here before was that loop in
Python, and it cost 47x CPython on `random()` and nearly two seconds per
megabyte of `randbytes` -- which is why test_zlib timed out, since CPython's
check_big_compress_buffer opens with randbytes(10 * 1024 * 1024) whether or
not -M was given.

So the split is the one `_iocore`/`_io` and `_zlibcore`/`zlib` already use.
`_randomcore` holds the state, the twist and the tempering, and takes fixed
positional arguments; this holds the class, the seeding rules, the argument
checking and the state tuple CPython's random.py pickles.

The sequence is the contract.  MT19937 is fully specified and every recorded
seed in CPython's tests depends on the exact stream, so `random()` takes 27
bits from the first word and 26 from the second in that order, `getrandbits`
composes little-endian words with the LAST one narrowed, and the state tuple
is 624 words followed by the cursor.  All of it is checked against CPython's
own output rather than against a distribution.
