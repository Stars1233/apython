"""atexit - callbacks to run at interpreter shutdown.

CPython's is a C module because the interpreter calls into it from its own
teardown.  Nothing here does that yet, so `register` records the callbacks
and `_run_exitfuncs` runs them; what is missing is the automatic call at
exit, not the bookkeeping.

logging, and everything behind it, imports atexit at module level and only
registers -- so the absence of the automatic call costs a flush at exit and
not correctness.
