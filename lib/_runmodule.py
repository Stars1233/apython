"""_runmodule - what `apython -m <module>` runs.

CPython's is runpy._run_module_as_main, and it is Python there for the same
reason it is Python here: finding a module means walking sys.path and asking
the import machinery, and neither exists until the interpreter has finished
starting.  So `-m` becomes a fixed bootstrap command in main.asm -- the
module name is left in sys.argv[0], which is where this reads it and where
CPython leaves the module's own file once it is resolved.

What it does NOT do is import the module.  Importing would run the body under
its own name and then again as __main__, which is both wrong and visible.  So
the source file is found, compiled, and executed in __main__'s existing
namespace -- the one main.asm already built, with __builtins__ in it.

`importlib` is deliberately not used: it is CPython's own Python package and
does not ship in lib/, so a standalone interpreter would have nothing to
call.  The parent package of a dotted name IS imported, because that is the
only way to know where to look for the child, and CPython imports it too.
