"""_testcapi - the few things CPython's TEST HARNESS reads off it.

Like lib/_testinternalcapi.py, and for the same reason: this is not CPython's
_testcapi, which is a C module exercising the public C API.  It is a stand-in
for what `test.support` looks up while it is being imported or while a
decorator is being evaluated, because those lookups sit at module scope and
an ImportError there takes a whole test module down before any of its tests
run.

test_call is the one that costs the most.  It writes

    _instance = _testcapi.MethInstance()

inside a class body, with the module fetched by a guarded import that leaves
None behind on failure -- so the whole file died on "'NoneType' object has no
attribute 'MethInstance'", and 181 tests with it.  That one cannot be stood
in for: MethInstance exists to exercise the C-level vectorcall protocol,
which this interpreter does not have.  What is here is only what
test.support itself reads, so the modules that merely IMPORT it survive.

Every name answers a true fact about this interpreter or raises
NotImplementedError when called.  Nothing here pretends to exercise a C API
that is not there.

# fallback, which is the value to agree with.
#
# They are not decoration: test_socket reads INT_MAX at MODULE scope

# The three classes test_call builds its calling-convention matrix from.
#
# CPython's are C types whose methods are each registered under a different
# METH_* convention -- VARARGS, VARARGS|KEYWORDS, O, NOARGS, FASTCALL,
# FASTCALL|KEYWORDS -- and the point of the matrix is that all six arrive at
# the same answer.  Here there is ONE calling convention, so these are six
# ordinary methods wearing the C names, and what they prove is that the answer
# is the same, not that six conventions reached it.  That is the honest claim,
# and it is worth making: test_call's line 479 builds an instance at CLASS-BODY
# scope, so without these the whole module -- 181 tests -- died before it ran.
#
# What is NOT here: pyobject_fastcall, pyobject_vectorcall,
# pyobject_fastcalldict, make_vectorcall_class, has_vectorcall_flag and the
# MethodDescriptor family.  Those exercise the C vectorcall protocol itself
# rather than a result, there is no such protocol here, and a stand-in would
# be claiming to test something that does not exist.  The tests that reach for
# them fail by name, which is the report a reader can act on.
