"""_imp - the import system's own primitives.

CPython's _imp is a C module, and importlib's bootstrap is written against
it: acquire_lock and release_lock around the import machinery, is_builtin and
create_builtin for the modules the interpreter carries inside it, is_frozen
and get_frozen_object for the ones it has as marshalled code, create_dynamic
for extension modules, and source_hash for a hash-based .pyc.

None of that needs to be C here.  This interpreter is single-threaded, so the
lock is a counter; there are no frozen modules and no extension modules, so
those answer "no" honestly rather than raising; and a builtin is imported by
asking the interpreter for it, which is what __import__ does.

The reason to have it at all is that importlib will not load without it, and
importlib is what twenty-one modules of CPython's Lib/ reach for -- usually a
few lines after some other import that appeared to be the blocker.
