# Known bugs

Open items only.  A bug that has been fixed belongs in the commit that fixed
it, not here; this file is the list of what is still wrong.

Every entry below was reproduced against the current build.  Each says what
the difference from CPython 3.12 is and, where it is known, why it is not a
one-line fix.

Divergences that are *deliberate* -- the `posix` subset, the absence of managed
dicts, a single-threaded `_thread`, the three recorded-oracle tests, and the
rest -- are not bugs and are not here.  They live in `DIVERGENCES.md`, with the
reasoning that chose them and what changing one would cost.

## Correctness

- **Missing C modules.**  The ranking here is by what actually stands in the
  way rather than by which import fails first -- the two are not the same,
  and `_imp` was reached by twelve modules a few lines after some other
  import that looked like the blocker.  `_imp`, `marshal`, `_warnings`,
  `_typing`, the `_sha*`/`_md5` family and `_posixsubprocess` are there now,
  and `importlib`, `hashlib`, `random` and `subprocess` with them.  So is
  `_signal`, with delivery at the top of a loop the way CPython's is, and
  `doctest`, `pdb`, `unittest` and `signal` with it.  What is left blocks one or two modules
  apiece and is genuinely C: `termios` (2), then `zlib`, `unicodedata`,
  `_tracemalloc`, `_symtable`, `_ssl`, `_sqlite3`, `_crypt`, `_lzma`, `_bz2`,
  `_ctypes`, `_curses`, `pyexpat` and `_tkinter`.
  (`_io` is not among them: `src/iomod.asm` supplies `_iocore` and
  `lib/_io.py` assembles both halves under the name `_io`.  `_socket` and
  `select` are the same split over `_socketcore`.  Neither are `math`,
  `_collections`, `_struct`, `_random`, `_contextvars`, `_string`,
  `_tokenize`, `_operator`, `binascii`, `atexit` and `_ast`, which are
  there.)  `make check-stdlib` gives the current figure: 170 of 196.

  `math`'s `gamma`, `lgamma`, the n-ary `hypot` and `sumprod` round
  differently from CPython's, which uses its own Lanczos approximation and
  double-double arithmetic where these use glibc and a Neumaier sum.  `dist`
  shares `hypot`'s routine and so shares the note.  `fsum` is exact: it is
  Shewchuk's algorithm, as CPython's is.  `tests/test_math.py` says which is
  which.

- **`range` clamps a bound wider than an index.**  Its three bounds are int64
  fields where CPython holds objects, so `range(1 << 1000)` is representable
  there and not here -- `_collections_abc` builds one at import to name the
  type its iterator has, and refusing it takes the standard library with it,
  so the bound is clamped.  `len(range(2**70))` therefore answers 2**63 - 1
  where CPython raises, and `type(iter(range(1 << 1000)))` is
  `range_iterator` where CPython has a second type for the wide case.

- **Functions with no docblock at all**, and, among those that have one,
  docblocks with no `->` signature line.  The signature is the only part of a
  function's contract that nothing checks, so its absence is a real gap rather
  than a cosmetic one.  This is the one item here a script cannot finish:
  writing a signature means reading what the function actually returns.  It is
  measured now rather than estimated -- `tests/docblock_floor.txt` holds the
  count per file and `lint.py`'s `check_docblocks` fails when one goes above
  it, so what is left can only shrink.
