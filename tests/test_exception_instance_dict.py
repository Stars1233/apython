# An exception's instance dict is exc_dict, and the type has to SAY so.
#
# The static exception types left tp_dictoffset at zero, and type_from_parts
# then treated an exception base like any other builtin with a fixed header:
# it put a second dict slot at the base's tp_basicsize and grew tp_basicsize
# by a word.  Every exception constructor allocates exactly
# PyExceptionObject_size regardless, so that offset pointed one word off the
# END of the object -- and obj_generic_attr and object.__getstate__, which
# both go through tp_dictoffset, read and WROTE there.
#
# With the offset set, the generic machinery finds the same dict exc_getattr
# and exc_setattr have always used, and a subclass inherits it rather than
# inventing a second one.  CPython's test_mailbox died on the read.
