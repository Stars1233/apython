# `from m import X` where m has no X says WHICH name, from WHICH module, and
# where that module was loaded from.
#
# CPython builds three wordings in ceval.c's import_from:
#
#     cannot import name 'X' from 'm' (/path/to/m.py)
#     cannot import name 'X' from 'm' (unknown location)      -- no __file__
#     cannot import name 'X' from partially initialized module 'm'
#         (most likely due to a circular import) (/path/to/m.py)
#
# and sets `.name` to the module's name and `.path` to its file, which is how
# a caller tells "the module is missing" from "the module is there and the
# name is not".
#
# We raised a bare `ImportError: cannot import name`, with neither the name
# nor the module in it and with `.name`/`.path` unset -- so the message named
# nothing at all and told you nothing about which of the two things went
# wrong.
#
# The absolute path cannot be diffed against python3 (the stdlib lives
# somewhere else there), so this prints the message with the parenthesised
# location replaced by whether it is a real file, plus the two attributes.
#
# The partially-initialized variant is NOT covered: it needs a module
# __spec__ with _initializing set, and ours are None.  bugs.md records it.
