# super() through a proxy that forwards attribute access.
#
# CPython's supercheck asks three questions: is the object an instance of the
# class, is it a subclass of the class, and -- the third -- does it SAY it is an
# instance of the class.  The third is what makes super() work through a proxy,
# and is what test_descr.test_proxy_super is for.
#
# op_load_super_attr asked all three; super_check, which every shape that does
# NOT compile to LOAD_SUPER_ATTR goes through, asked only the first two.  Both
# raise the same sentence, so the difference read as position-dependent --
# bugs.md recorded it as an answer that changed when an unrelated later
# statement was deleted.  It is not: it is which of two code paths the shape
# compiles to.
