# The ordinary suite hands apython a .pyc that CPython produced; this hands it
# the .py and makes apython compile it.  Every file is a differential test of
# the compiler against CPython for free, and it is the only thing that has ever
# exercised the compiler on a large body of ordinary code -- most of its bugs
# were found here rather than by a test written for them.
#
# Ratchets against tests/compile_floor.txt: a file that used to match and now
# does not is a failure, and so is a file that crashes.  Raise the floor with
#
#     bash tests/source_probe.sh --record
#
# in the commit that earns it.

# our own bytecode has no caret rows under it.  That is a real gap, recorded
# in bugs.md, but it is not the compiler getting an answer wrong.
