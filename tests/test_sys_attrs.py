# The sys attributes a program asks for by name.
#
# None of these is decoration.  test.support and regrtest read _xoptions and
# _git on the way in, so their absence stopped fifty-five and twenty-seven of
# CPython's tests before any of them ran; api_version and _stdlib_dir are read
# by platform; getsizeof is what test.support.check_sizeof is written on and
# what lib/_testinternalcapi.py adds a GC header to; and __spec__, __loader__
# and __package__ are what every module HAS -- sys is built by hand in
# assembly and never goes through import_load_module, which is the only reason
# it had none of them.
#
# breakpoint() was a no-op stub, so it silently did nothing at all.  It now
# calls sys.breakpointhook, which is where a debugger replaces it -- and
# sys.breakpointhook IS sys.__breakpointhook__, which is how a program asks
# whether anything has.
