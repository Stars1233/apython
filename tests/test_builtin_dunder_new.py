"""A builtin that keeps its constructor in tp_new must still publish __new__.

The stdlib asks by NAME.  `super().__new__(cls, ...)` resolves along the MRO,
and a builtin whose constructor is only a slot has nothing there -- so the
search runs on to object.__new__, which refuses a type whose real constructor
is elsewhere.  That is:

  * every subclass that writes its own __new__ and chains to the base, which
    is how `_CallableGenericAlias` in _collections_abc is written -- so
    `collections.abc.Callable[[int], int]` raised outright;
  * every copy.copy, copy.deepcopy and pickle of a subclass of one of them,
    because the reduce protocol reconstructs through __new__.

bugs.md recorded this for `bytes`.  It is a family.
