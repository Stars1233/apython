# asyncio's stream layer, over a real socket.
#
# What was here before was assembly that predated any socket support: it
# hard-coded 127.0.0.1 and ignored the host it was given, discarded what
# connect() returned, read into a fixed stack buffer, handed back `str` where
# CPython hands back `bytes`, and raised OSErrors built from fixed strings
# with no errno -- so `except ConnectionRefusedError` could not catch one.  It
# had no test, which is how all of that survived.
#
# The loop owes the Python half exactly one primitive: wait_fd(fd, events),
# an awaitable that suspends the running task until a descriptor is ready.
# That is the same IO_WAIT sentinel the old assembly yielded; it is simply
# reachable now.
