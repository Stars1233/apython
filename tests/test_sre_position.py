"""Matching at a position, and the ASCII/non-ASCII split behind it.

`sre_state_init` used to decide whether a subject was ASCII by scanning every
one of its bytes, and `sre_match_get_group_str` ran the identical loop again on
every `m.group(n)`.  Both answers are already on the str object -- ob_size is
the byte length and ob_length the code-point length, and they are equal iff the
string is pure ASCII -- so an incremental parser was paying O(len(subject))
twice per token where CPython pays nothing.  json.loads went quadratic on it.

The functional risk in replacing a scan with that comparison is that some way
of *building* a string leaves ob_length disagreeing with reality, so most of
this file is the same match driven over strings made many different ways.  The
last section is the complexity guard: cost per match must not grow with the
part of the subject the match never looks at.
