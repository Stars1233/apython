# CALL_PY_EXACT_ARGS moves each argument's stack reference INTO the callee's
# frame rather than incrementing it and releasing the slot afterwards.  That is
# only balanced because frame_free releases every localsplus entry and the
# handler's guards make it run unconditionally -- so every way a parameter can
# stop being the thing the caller pushed is a case here:
#
#   the callee rebinds it, deletes it, or returns it
#   the callee raises, so the frame is freed on the error path
#   the frame is captured -- by a traceback or by a closure  (sys._getframe is
#     NOT here: it leaks the frame's locals on its own, which predates this and
#     is recorded in bugs.md)
#   the argument's ONLY reference was the stack slot
#   both call shapes: a plain function and a bound method (self is an argument)
#
# A missed reference is a leak; an extra release is a use-after-free that
# surfaces somewhere else entirely.  gc.collect() and the identity checks are
# what make either visible from Python.
