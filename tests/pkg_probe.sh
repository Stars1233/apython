# pkg_probe.sh - CPython's PACKAGE-style test directories, run under apython.
#
# CPython's Lib/test holds two kinds of test module: a file, test_foo.py, and
# a package, test_foo/.  Every sweep this project ran globbed the first kind
# only, so the second was never measured at all -- twenty-one directories
# holding, in the CPython control, five thousand passing tests.  Three of them
# segfaulted the first time they were run.
#
# This is a ratchet over that region, not a report.  Each directory is run in
# a fresh process and classified:
#
#   OK      every test it ran passed
#   FAILED  it ran tests and some did not pass
#   ERROR   it ran no tests -- an import died, or a SkipTest at module scope
#   CRASH   the process died on a signal
#   HANG    it did not finish inside the timeout
#
# Compared against tests/pkg_floor.txt, which records the per-directory count
# of PASSING tests and the crash set.  A directory that passes fewer tests
# than it did, or a new crash, fails the target.  Raise the floor with
#   bash tests/pkg_probe.sh --record
# in the commit that earns it.
#
# Needs CPython's Lib/ (a source checkout, not an installed python).  Point
# $CPYTHON_LIB at it; the target skips cleanly when it is not there, so a
# build never depends on an out-of-tree checkout.
#
# A package cannot be named on the command line the way a file can, so each
# is driven through unittest's own loader, the way CPython's own suite is:
#
#   apython -m unittest test.<pkg>
