"""os.PathLike arguments, and the path they leave behind.

posix_path_arg resolves str, bytes and anything with __fspath__.  The first
two hand back a pointer into the caller's own object and own nothing; the
third builds a new str, and its contract said so in a flag that none of its
eleven callers read.  Every PathLike argument leaked its resolved path.

The release belongs immediately after the syscall and before the errno
check: by then the kernel has copied the path out, and a raise abandons the
C stack without running anything placed after it.
