# zip() over iterables of different lengths releases the round it could not
# finish exactly once.
#
# zip_iternext builds the result tuple with tuple_new, which zero-fills it,
# and stores each item as its iterator yields one.  When a LATER iterator is
# the one that runs out, the partial-cleanup path DECREF'd the items already
# stored and then released the tuple -- and tuple_dealloc walks the same slots
# and releases them again.  Every element of the longer iterable that landed
# in the last, incomplete round lost a reference it still had, and the object
# was freed under whatever still pointed at it.
#
# It needs the SECOND iterable to be the short one: with the first exhausted,
# nothing has been stored yet and the double release has nothing to bite.
