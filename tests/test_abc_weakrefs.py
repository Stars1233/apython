# The _abc registry and its caches hold weak references.
#
# They held strong ones, so a class registered against an ABC -- or merely
# asked about once, which fills a cache -- lived as long as the ABC did.
# Registries are process-lifetime, so that is a leak with no upper bound on
# what it holds: a class, its dict, its methods, and whatever those close
# over.  bugs.md said "revisit if _weakref lands"; it has.
#
# A ref with no callback is SHARED here, so the same class always yields the
# same object.  That is what makes a set lookup find what a registration put
# there: no special comparison is needed, and a weakref hashes as its
# referent does.
