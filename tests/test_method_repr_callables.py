# repr() of a bound method whose function is neither a Python function nor a
# builtin.
#
# method_repr routed func_type one way and builtin_func_type another, and for
# anything else read PyBuiltinObject.func_name off it -- whatever sat at +24
# in an object of a different shape, dereferenced as a string.  It is a
# segfault from ordinary Python: types.MethodType over any callable that is
# not one of those two, which is how a class with __call__ binds and what
# CPython's test_descr does.
#
# CPython's method_repr asks the object: __qualname__, then __name__, and "?"
# when neither is a str.  The names are set on the INSTANCE here because a
# class's __qualname__ lives in its tp_dict in this tree and in a getset on
# `type` in CPython, so an instance of a plain class finds one here and not
# there -- a divergence of its own, recorded in bugs.md, and not what this
# file is about.
