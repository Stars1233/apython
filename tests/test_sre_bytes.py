# A bytes pattern matches bytes and answers bytes.
#
# SRE_State had an is_bytes field that nothing ever set or read: every
# pattern was a str pattern, every subject had to be a str, and
# `re.compile(rb'...')` was impossible.  CPython's own tokenize.detect_encoding
# uses one, which is what kept hashlib, random and uu out.
#
# The engine itself is unchanged: bytes are byte-indexed, which is the ASCII
# path it already had.  What is new is that the pattern records which kind it
# is, that the subject must match, and that every result -- groups, splits,
# substitutions, templates -- is built as that kind.
#
# This test has no CPython oracle, for the reason tests/test_sre.py gives:
# it feeds hand-written SRE bytecode to _sre.compile, which does not validate
# it, and CPython segfaults on some of it.  Every step asserts.
