"""The four sharp corrections in bugs.md's tail, each with its own repro.

None of them is about a missing feature: every one is a message or an
attribute that answered something CPython does not, in code that ran.

  * an unbound `super` was not a descriptor, so the idiom
    `C._C__super = super(C)` then `self.__super.meth()` read the unbound
    super straight back and every name on it missed;
  * `super(C, proxy)` searched the MRO of the class it was WRITTEN with
    rather than the one the proxy declares, and reported the written one as
    `__self_class__`;
  * `o.__dict__ = d` added a key spelled '__dict__' and left the real dict
    alone, and `o.__weakref__ = x` quietly succeeded;
  * an AttributeError carried neither `.name` nor `.obj`, which is what the
    "Did you mean" machinery and a __getattr__ hook's own miss test read.
