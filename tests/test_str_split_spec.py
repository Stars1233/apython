# The separator scan is now one ap_memfind per piece rather than one ap_memcmp
# per byte, so what matters is the cases where a search either finds nothing,
# finds something at position zero, or finds something that runs to the very
# end -- and separators of one byte, which take a different path inside
# ap_memfind (straight to ap_memchr) from longer ones.
#
# The whitespace scan is a 256-entry table lookup rather than a six-way compare
# ladder reached through a call, so every byte the table classifies is walked
# here, in a haystack and on its own.
#
# And each piece is built without recounting its code points when the haystack
# is ASCII -- which is only sound BECAUSE it is ASCII, so the non-ASCII cases
# below are what say the general path is still taken when it must be.  A piece
# whose length is wrong shows up as a wrong len(), never as a wrong repr.

# The whitespace the byte table classifies.  \x1c-\x1f are in it because
# CPython's split() and strip() treat them as whitespace; the compare ladder
# this replaced had left them out, which was a wrong answer.

# NOT tested here: U+0085, U+00A0, U+2028 and the other Unicode spaces, which
# CPython also splits on.  They are two or three bytes in UTF-8, so no byte
# table can see them and the split loops would have to decode.  bugs.md.
