# The reduction protocol for the builtins that had none.

# copy.deepcopy({1, 2, 3}) was set().  Not an error -- an empty set, silently,
# from a function ordinary code uses everywhere.  The cause is that set,
# frozenset, bytearray and every exception carry no __reduce__, so
# lib/_reduce.py's override test finds object's and falls through to
# _reduce_newobj, which names the class and never its contents.  str, tuple and
# bytes have the same hole one level down: no __getnewargs__, so a SUBCLASS of
# one of them rebuilds empty.
#
# CPython supplies all of these in C.  Everything below is measured against it.
