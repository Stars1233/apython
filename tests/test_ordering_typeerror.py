# Ordering comparisons that raise, with operands that die when they do.
#
# Two heap-corrupting bugs met here, and neither was visible without an
# allocation after the raise -- the damage was to malloc's free list, so the
# crash landed arbitrarily far away.
#
#   1. op_compare_op's identity fallback DECREFed both operands and then
#      raised.  eval_exception_unwind releases the frame's value stack from
#      above the slots the operands were VPOPped out of, so it decremented the
#      refcount word of memory malloc had already put on its tcache list --
#      overwriting the list's forward pointer.  `object() < object()`,
#      `range(1) < range(2)` and `int < str` all did it.
#
#   2. object_type_call built its instance with gc_alloc, which does not INCREF
#      the type it stamps into ob_type, while instance_dealloc DECREFs it.
#      object_type starts at refcount 1, so the first object() to be collected
#      handed &object_type -- a .data address -- to free().
#
# So every case below constructs its operands as temporaries, and every group
# is followed by allocation churn: without the churn the corruption is silent.
