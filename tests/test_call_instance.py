"""Calling an instance whose class defines __call__, by every route.

`__call__` had no slot_table row, so tp_call stayed 0 on every heaptype and
`x()` worked only because op_call and obj_call_n each hand-rolled a lookup.
Everything that consults tp_call directly did not: `f(*args)` was a TypeError,
`callable()` answered False, and iter(o, sentinel), min/max's key= and the
weakref and signal callback checks all refused a perfectly good callable.

So this file is less about `__call__` than about the paths that reach it.
