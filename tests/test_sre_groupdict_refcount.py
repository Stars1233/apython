# groupdict(default) must own the default it stores.
#
# sre_match_groupdict_method substituted the caller's `default` for every
# unmatched group and then DECREFed after dict_set -- correct for the fresh
# strings sre_match_get_group_str hands back, one short for the default, which
# is borrowed from the argument array.  groups() had always INCREFed there and
# even said why; groupdict() had not.
#
# The damage was invisible in ordinary use because the default is usually a
# constant the code object keeps alive.  It surfaced at interpreter shutdown,
# where whichever of the two owners died first took the string with it and the
# other read freed memory -- and only became a crash when an unrelated change
# moved the heap enough for glibc to notice.  See bugs.md history and
# tests/test_sre2.py, which exercised groupdict('N/A') without catching it.
#
# So this file builds the default at RUN TIME and drops every other reference
# to it before touching the dict: if groupdict does not own it, the string is
# freed while the dict still points at it.
