# rc_sweep.sh - the release-candidate measurement: CPython's own Lib/test,
# run under apython, and the same corpus run under CPython for a control.
#
# This is the instrument the RC gate is judged by, and it is a REPORT rather
# than a ratchet -- it takes about ten minutes a side, which is too long for
# `make check`.  The ratchets over subsets of the same ground are
# tests/stdlib_probe.sh (can a module be imported at all) and
# tests/pkg_probe.sh (the package-style test directories).  This one is the
# whole of Lib/test/test_*.py, which is where the headline percentage comes
# from.
#
#   bash tests/rc_sweep.sh ap      # apython
#   bash tests/rc_sweep.sh cp      # CPython, for the control
#
# Results land in $OUTDIR (default: a directory under /tmp named for the
# side): one log per module, plus sweep-<side>.tsv with a row per module of
#
#   name  category  exit  ran  failing  skipped  last-exception-line
#
# Categories: OK, FAILED, IMPORT, SYNTAX, SKIP, NOTESTS, ERROR, CRASH, HANG.
# The number that matters is `passing`, summed -- and it is `ran` minus the
# DISTINCT tests that failed, counted from the FAIL:/ERROR: headers, not from
# the summary line.  unittest's summary does not close: one test can report
# several errors (setUp and a cleanup both raising is two), so
# `ran - failures - errors` goes negative.  test_tools really does say
# "Ran 39 tests" and "errors=45".
#
# Three traps this script exists to avoid, each of which has cost a whole
# wasted sweep at some point:
#
#  1. PYTHONPATH must name Lib/, not Lib/test/.  apython adds the script's own
#     directory, so without it every module dies on `import random` and the
#     sweep measures nothing.
#  2. grep needs -a.  A test that writes a NUL byte turns its log into a
#     binary file, and grep then answers nothing rather than the count, so the
#     module silently scores zero.
#  3. A module that forks, or that execs, can replace or outlive the runner.
#     The ulimit and the timeout are what keep one bad module from taking the
#     sweep with it.
#  4. Each module runs in a scratch directory of its own, thrown away
#     afterwards.  They used to run in the REPO ROOT, and a test that writes
#     in its cwd left the file there: `tempcwd/`, `@test_<pid>_tmp*` and once
#     a 586 MB one from test_largefile.  Two things came of that.  The debris
#     showed up as untracked files and got committed by anyone reaching for
#     `git add -A`; and, worse, it perturbed the NEXT run -- a leftover
#     `tempcwd/` makes test_pydoc, test_warnings, test_shutil, test_subprocess
#     and test_tarfile report failures that are not there, which has been
#     mistaken for a regression more than once.
