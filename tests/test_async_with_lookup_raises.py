# A __aexit__ lookup that raises must not release the context manager.
#
# BEFORE_ASYNC_WITH's `.baw_lookup_raised` is reached only from
# `.baw_exit_missing` -- before anything is pushed -- so the manager is still
# in the value-stack slot VPOP_VAL read it from and the unwinder releases that.
# Releasing it here as well took one reference per failure, and the third
# `async with` over the same manager segfaulted in gc_list_remove.  The
# synchronous twin's own arm records the rule and does not release.
