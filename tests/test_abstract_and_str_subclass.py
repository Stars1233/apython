# Two entries bugs.md carried that no longer reproduce.
#
# "@abc.abstractmethod is not enforced" -- it is: type_call consults
# __abstractmethods__ and abc's bookkeeping fills it.  The message differed
# too, once, which is why the older checks here compare the exception type
# rather than its text; the block at the end compares the text, because it
# now matches.
#
# "A str subclass has no instance __dict__" -- it has one.  A str keeps its
# characters inline, so the dict cannot sit at a fixed offset past the header;
# TP_DICT_AT_TAIL puts it after the data instead, and bytes and tuple
# subclasses get theirs the same way.

#
# It used to be "Can't instantiate abstract class with abstract methods",
# which names neither -- and those are the two things the reader needs.
# CPython sorts the names and agrees the noun with how many there are.
