# lex_cp_at checked the SEQUENCE LENGTH and nothing else, and handed an
# unrecognised lead byte back as its own code point -- several of which
# (0xAA, 0xB5, 0xBA, 0xF8..0xFF) are XID_Start.  So `\xff = 1` compiled and
# bound a name whose one code point was U+1C0000: outside Unicode, and a str
# whose code-point count did not match its bytes.
#
# Worse in the quiet direction: a Latin-1 source compiled to a DIFFERENT
# PROGRAM.  In `x = caf\xe9\ny = 2` the 0xE9 claimed three bytes, swallowing
# the newline and the `y`, so two statements became one.
#
# CPython refuses the file as a codec error with a position of its own;
# bugs.md records that wording difference.  What matters is the refusal.
