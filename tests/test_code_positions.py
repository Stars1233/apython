# co_positions() and co_lines(), the two side tables the stdlib walks.
#
# co_positions() answered (line, line, None, None) for every code unit, on
# the ground that this tree recorded lines and not columns.  That stopped
# being true when the caret renderer was written: code_addr2location decodes
# the start and end column out of the same PEP 657 table, and
# src/traceback.asm has been drawing carets from them ever since.  So
# CPython's own traceback.py -- which any program using the real stdlib
# reaches -- drew none, while apython's renderer drew them correctly from the
# same data.
#
# co_lines() did not exist, and dis, trace and inspect all iterate it.
