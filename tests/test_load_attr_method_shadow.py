"""A warm method cache notices an instance attribute that shadows the class.

LOAD_ATTR_METHOD (203) guards on the receiver's type and on that type's dict
version.  Neither says anything about the INSTANCE dict, so once a site was
warm, `c.m = something` was ignored and `c.m()` went on calling the class's
method -- a wrong answer, not a slow one.

It needs the SAME call site to run before and after the shadow.  A fresh site
is cold and takes the generic path, so the obvious test -- warm it in a loop,
then read `c.m` on the next line -- passes while the bug is live.  Every case
below funnels through one function for that reason.

bugs.md described this hazard as something a hypothetical new opcode would
have to avoid.  It was already live: 203 has been installed for classes
written in Python since the method-load work, and its guards were the ones
written for a static builtin type, whose instances have no dict to shadow
with.
