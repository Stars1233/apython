"""A .pyc whose source has been edited since must not be used.

A .pyc records the source's mtime and size in its header, and CPython refuses
one that no longer matches.  Without that check, editing a module and running
it again silently runs the old code -- which is what happened here, and what
makes the compiled `lib/` a trap rather than a cache the moment one of its
sources is touched by hand.

The cache this needs is built by copying one that already exists, because
this interpreter never writes a .pyc of its own and marshal.dumps is not
here to make one.  Aligning the copy's mtime with the header makes the pair
agree; appending a line to the source makes them disagree in both the size
and the mtime, which is the case the check is for.
