# Every builtin binary operator against every builtin type, in both operand
# orders.  What is compared is the *protocol* -- which pairs are legal and what
# kind of thing comes out -- not arithmetic values; tests/test_arithmetic.py and
# tests/test_binop_mixed_values.py cover those.
#
# It exists because the builtin numeric slots used to trust whatever operand
# they were handed.  `1 + "a"` read the string's ob_length and answered 2;
# `1 + [1]` read past the end of a list and then wrote an mpz_t over its header;
# `{1,2} | 5` and `True * [1,2]` -- the second of which is legal Python --
# dumped core.  Nothing in the suite covered the quadrant, because
# tests/test_operand_types.py only ever puts the sequence on the left.
#
# Only names and small exact values are printed.  Our TypeError text is the
# fixed string "unsupported operand type(s)" where CPython names the operator
# and both types, so str(e) can never be compared here; the exception's
# identity can.  A float result prints as its type alone unless it is integral,
# because agreeing on repr digits is a different subsystem's job.
