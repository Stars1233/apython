# A SUBCLASS of ExceptionGroup, split by `except*`.
#
# `except*` splits a group by constructing one of the group's OWN type, so a
# subclass reaches the group constructor.  That constructor allocated with the
# plain allocator, while a subclass of any exception type is given a dealloc
# that frees through the collector -- so the block went back sixteen bytes
# below where it came from, and `except*` over a subclassed group was a
# segfault.  It is why CPython's test_except_star and test_exception_group both
# died here.
#
# The same subclass had also lost the group's own slots to the generic
# exception ones, so `.exceptions` did not answer and the tuple behind it was
# never released.
#
# The split halves are printed by CONTENT rather than by type: apython builds
# them from the group's own type where CPython's default derive() builds a
# plain ExceptionGroup, which is a separate divergence recorded in bugs.md.
